### This is a project from where I actually tried applying what I had learned after taking a year long hiatus from programming and any kind of web development. 
### It didn't turn out very well and this entire project was broken from the very start
## nothing was meant to be beautiful, just usable.
# This is what they call a Fresh Start.
